Welcome to my new Jekyll blog! This is your first blog post, demonstrating how easy it is to write content in Markdown.

## Getting Started with Jekyll

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website.

### Why Jekyll?

- **Simple**: No databases, just files and folders
- **Fast**: Static sites are incredibly fast
- **Flexible**: Use Markdown, Liquid templates, and more
- **Free hosting**: GitHub Pages hosts Jekyll sites for free

### Writing Posts

To add new posts, simply create a file in the `_posts` directory with the following format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md
```

For example:
- `2026-02-25-my-first-post.md`
- `2026-03-01-another-great-article.md`

### Front Matter

Every post starts with YAML front matter:

```yaml

layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2026-02-25 08:00:00 +0100
categories: category-name
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

## Markdown Basics

Here are some Markdown formatting examples:

### Lists

Unordered list:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

Ordered list:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Code Blocks

Inline code: `var example = true`

Code block:
```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

### Blockquotes

## What's Next?

Now that your blog is set up, you can:

1. Customize `_config.yml` with your personal information
2. Create new posts in the `_posts` directory
3. Modify layouts and includes to change the design
4. Add custom CSS in `assets/css/`
5. Explore Jekyll plugins and themes

Happy blogging! 🚀
